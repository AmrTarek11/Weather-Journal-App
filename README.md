# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI.

## Instructions
This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.

## Extras
If you are interested in testing your code as you go, you can use `tests.js` as a template for writing and running some basic tests for your code.

### Development Strategy

* Setting up project environment, making sure Node and packages installed, and included in server.js file.
* Added POST and GET routes to ensure correct retrieval of data from the server.
* Acquired API credentials from OpenWeatherMap website.
* Created async functions to fetch weather data and store it on my local server.
* Set up a function that updated UI dynamically.
